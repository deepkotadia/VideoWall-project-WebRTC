# VideoWall-project-WebRTC
A demo of using WebRTC without a signalling server for video conferencing between two computers. This demo is further expanded into a video conferencing platform for multiple computers. Hence, this can then be used for remote browser streaming using a teleconferencing platform called the VideoWall, which is primarily used for distance education at Rutgers University.
